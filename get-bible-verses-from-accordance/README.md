# Keyboard Maestro Macros for getting verses from Accordance Bible Software

## Instructions

### Step 1. Download all files in the folder.

1. The Keyboard Maestro macro group file (`Bible Study Macros.kmmacros`).

2. The AppleScript file (`Martin Script Library`).

3. The three Accordance user Bible files (in the `userbibles` folder).

4. The zipped HTML files (`html files.zip`).

### Step 2. Installation

1. Double-click to install the macros to Keyboard Maestro.

2. Put the AppleScript file to the `~/Library/Scripts/` folder.
    * Note: the applescript also deals with Chinese Bible references. If you are not a Chinese user, you may not need some portion of it.

3. Put the three user Bible files to the `~/Library/Application Support/Accordance/Modules/Texts` folder (double-click each should also install them).

4. Unzip the html file and put it in a folder; then edit the orange action in macros #2 and #6 (see screenshot below).
