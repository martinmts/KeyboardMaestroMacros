# Countdown Timer with Alfred

The **Alfred workflow** (powerpack required) and the **KM macro** work together. The workflow will execute the KM macro by name.

You need to install both the Alfred workflow and the KM macro. The KM macro will not function by itself. It is triggered by the Alfred workflow..

Valid arguments in Alfred:
- "**timer 5**" means a **5 min** timer.
- "**timer 5s**" means a **5 sec** timer.
- "**timer 1.5m**" means a **1.5 min** timer.
- "**timer 0.5h**" means a **0.5 hr** timer.
