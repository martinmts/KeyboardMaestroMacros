# Read Current Hebrew Verse in Accordance.kmmacros

## Purpose:
- Read the verse shown in the "Go To Box" of Accordance Bible Software in background from the Hebrew audio Bible.

## Requirements:
1. You must have purchased and downloaded Hebrew Old Testament Audio - Accordance.
2. Enable and try the "Set Dictionary ..." action (in Orange) below once (then you may disable it).
3. The UI language must be English. Otherwise, you need to edit the menu-click action (in Green color).
4. The modules are saved to the default folder. Otherwise, you will have to edit the actions (in Yellow color).
5. The tab (in Accordance) containing the "Go To Box" must be the active tab.

That's it! Set/Change a hotkey for the macro and you are good to go!

## Comment:
- Be aware that the audio Bible module reads Hebrew for the Aramaic texts in the Hebrew Bible.
- I don't have a good way to get the reference as shown in the "Go To Box". If you know a better way, let me know!
